Bedmo Disco is four things:


- A DJ tag-team

- A record label (Bedmo Disco Records)

- A music production outfit

- A party crew


Since the start of the 2000s they've been promoting their love of disco, boogie, 
electrofunk, Italo-disco, synth jams, soul, funk, hip-hop, Afrobeat, Latin grooves, proto-house and other goodtime grooves to the masses, both in Bristol and further afield.

## Welcome

A one bar pub in a residential area close to several breweries in East Bristol. The L-shaped bar is simply furnished, with flagstone floors and high stools at the bar and the front window. Power and USB charging points are available above the shelf looking out onto the road.

The furnishings are simple, and the clientele made up of locals. Children are welcome until 7.30. There is a small garden at the rear and a large garden to the side with BBQs.

Music and DJs most weekends.
